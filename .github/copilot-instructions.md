## Microsoft Learn MCP Server

You have access to MCP tools called `microsoft_docs_search` and `microsoft_docs_fetch` - these tools allow you to search through and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

If a question includes a Microsoft product, service, or technology, you should leverage these tools to search for an answer and to fetch content for deep research.

## Star Wars MCP Server

You have access to a MCP Server that connects to the public Star Wars API (SWAPI) - https://swapi.dev/.
You can use this MCP Server to get information about Star Wars movies, characters, planets, starships, and more.

When a user asks a question related to Star Wars, you should use this MCP Server to retrieve accurate and up-to-date information from the SWAPI.
